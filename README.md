# MARVIN - Your AI Chief of Staff

MARVIN is an AI assistant that remembers your conversations, tracks your goals, and helps you stay organized. Like having a personal chief of staff who never forgets anything.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Download MARVIN

Click the green "Code" button above, then "Download ZIP". Unzip it somewhere on your computer (like your Downloads folder).

Or if you use git:
```
git clone https://github.com/SterlingChin/start-template.git marvin-template
```

### 2. Open in Claude Code

Open Claude Code and navigate to the folder you downloaded:
```
cd marvin-template
claude
```

### 3. Ask MARVIN to Help You Set Up

Just say:
> "Help me set up MARVIN"

MARVIN will walk you through everything step by step:
- Your name and role
- Your goals (work and personal)
- How you want MARVIN to communicate
- Where to create your personal workspace (default: ~/marvin)
- Optional: Connect to Google Calendar, Gmail, Jira, etc.

That's it! MARVIN handles the rest.

## How It Works

MARVIN creates a **personal workspace** separate from this template:

```
~/marvin/                    <- Your workspace (your data lives here)
├── CLAUDE.md               # Your profile and preferences
├── state/                  # Your goals and priorities
├── sessions/               # Your daily session logs
└── ...

~/Downloads/start-template/ <- Template (keep this for updates!)
├── .marvin/                # Setup scripts and integrations
└── ...
```

**Your workspace** is where all your personal data lives. It's yours to customize.

**The template** is where you get updates from. When new features are added, run `/sync` to pull them in.

---

## Daily Usage

Once set up, navigate to your workspace and start MARVIN:
```
cd ~/marvin
claude
```

Or if you set up the shortcut during onboarding, just type:
```
marvin
```

### Start Your Day
```
/start
```
MARVIN gives you a briefing: your priorities, deadlines, and progress.

### Throughout the Day
Just talk naturally:
- "Add a task: finish the report by Friday"
- "What should I focus on today?"
- "I finished the presentation"
- "What did we talk about yesterday?"

### Save Your Progress
```
/update
```
Quick save without ending the session.

### End Your Day
```
/end
```
MARVIN saves everything for next time.

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Start your day with a briefing |
| `/end` | End session and save everything |
| `/update` | Quick checkpoint (save progress) |
| `/report` | Generate a weekly summary |
| `/commit` | Review and commit git changes |
| `/code` | Open in your IDE |
| `/sync` | Get updates from the template |
| `/help` | Show all commands and integrations |

---

## Getting Updates

When new features are added to MARVIN:

1. Update your template folder (git pull or re-download)
2. Open your workspace in Claude Code
3. Run `/sync`

Your personal data is never overwritten. Only new commands and skills are added.

---

## Migrating from an Older Version

If you were using MARVIN before the workspace separation update, run the migration script to move to the new architecture without losing any data.

### 1. Get the Latest Template

```
git clone https://github.com/SterlingChin/start-template.git marvin-template
```

Or if you already have it cloned, run `git pull` to get the latest.

### 2. Run the Migration Script

```
cd marvin-template
./.marvin/migrate.sh
```

### 3. Follow the Prompts

The script will ask:
- Where your current MARVIN installation is
- Where you want your new workspace (default: ~/marvin)

It automatically copies all your data:
- Your profile (CLAUDE.md)
- Goals and priorities (state/)
- Session logs (sessions/)
- Reports and content
- Any custom skills you created

### 4. Verify and Clean Up

Once you confirm everything works in your new workspace, you can delete your old MARVIN folder.
