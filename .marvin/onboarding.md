# MARVIN Onboarding Guide

This guide walks new users through setting up MARVIN. Read by MARVIN when setup is not yet complete.

---

## Important: Integration Setup

**DO NOT run setup scripts via Bash during onboarding.** The scripts use interactive `read` prompts that don't work well from within Claude Code.

Instead, for Atlassian and MS365:
1. Run `claude mcp add` commands directly (see Step 7)
2. User must restart Claude Code for new MCPs to appear
3. After restart, user types `/mcp` to authenticate
4. MARVIN detects pending auth state and guides them through it

---

## How to Detect Onboarding State

**Check in this order:**

### 1. Check for Pending Integration Auth (restart needed)

Look for the file `.onboarding-pending-auth` in the workspace root.

If this file exists:
- Read it to see which integrations need authentication
- Skip to **"Resuming After Restart"** section below
- Guide user through `/mcp` authentication for each integration
- Delete the file when done
- Complete onboarding with Steps 8-10

### 2. Check for Fresh Setup Needed

Check these signs:
- Does `state/current.md` contain "{{" placeholders or "[Add your priorities here]"?
- Does `state/goals.md` contain placeholder text?
- Is there NO personalized user information in `CLAUDE.md`?

If any of these are true, run the full onboarding flow starting at Step 1.

---

## Resuming After Restart (Integration Auth)

If `.onboarding-pending-auth` exists, the user just restarted to authenticate integrations.

**First, read the file to see which integrations need auth:**
```bash
cat .onboarding-pending-auth
```

**Greet them warmly:**
> "Welcome back, {name}! You're almost done - just need to connect your accounts now. This is the last step, I promise."

---

### For Atlassian and MS365 (need `/mcp` auth)

> "Type `/mcp` right here. You should see your integrations listed."

**Wait for them to type `/mcp`**, then guide them through each:

> "Great! Now:
> 1. Select '{integration_name}' from the list
> 2. Choose 'Authenticate'
> 3. A browser window will open - log in with your {service} account
> 4. Once you see 'success' in the browser, come back here
>
> Let me know when you're done!"

---

### For Google Workspace (authenticates on first use)

Google authenticates automatically when you first use it - no `/mcp` needed.

> "Let me test Google real quick..."

Try: "What's on my Google Calendar today?" or any Google Workspace tool.

A browser window will open for them to log in. After they authenticate, the request will complete.

---

### For Slack (uses token directly)

Slack uses the API token they provided - no additional auth needed.

> "Let me test Slack real quick..."

Try: "List my Slack channels" or any Slack tool.

If it works, they're connected. If not, the token might be wrong - ask them to verify it.

---

### Testing Each Integration

**After they confirm each integration:**
- Ask: "Did it work? Let me test it real quick..."
- Try a simple test:
  - **Atlassian:** "What Jira projects do you have access to?"
  - **MS365:** "What's on your Outlook calendar today?"
  - **Google:** "What's on my Google Calendar today?"
  - **Slack:** "List my Slack channels"
- If it works: "Perfect! {Integration} is connected."
- If it fails: See troubleshooting below.

---

### Troubleshooting

**Atlassian/MS365 (if `/mcp` auth doesn't work):**

1. "Let's try `/mcp` again - do you see {integration} in the list?"
   - If NO: The MCP wasn't added. Re-run the `claude mcp add` command, then restart again.
   - If YES but not authenticated: Select it and try 'Authenticate' again.

2. "Sometimes the browser auth doesn't complete properly. Try these steps:"
   - Close any old browser tabs from previous auth attempts
   - In `/mcp`, select the integration and choose 'Authenticate'
   - Complete the login in the new browser window
   - Wait for the success message before coming back

**Google (if browser auth doesn't work):**

1. Check that the OAuth credentials are correct
2. Make sure the Gmail, Calendar, and Drive APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Try the request again - it should open a new browser window

**Slack (if commands fail):**

1. Verify the token starts with `xoxp-` (not `xoxb-`)
2. Check that all required scopes were added to the Slack app
3. Try reinstalling the Slack app to your workspace and getting a fresh token

**If still stuck:** "Let's skip this for now and try again later. Just ask me 'help me connect to {integration}' anytime."

---

### When Done

1. Delete the pending auth file:
   ```bash
   rm .onboarding-pending-auth
   ```

2. Celebrate:
   > "Awesome! All your integrations are connected. You're all set!"

3. Give them their first briefing:
   > "Type `/start` and let's get to work!"

---

## Onboarding Flow

Be friendly and patient - assume the user is not technical.

### Step 1: Welcome

Say something like:
> "Welcome! I'm MARVIN, and I'll be your AI Chief of Staff. Let me help you get set up. This will take about 10 minutes, and I'll walk you through everything."

### Step 2: Gather Basic Info

Ask these questions one at a time, waiting for answers:

1. "What's your name?"

2. "What's your job title or role?" (e.g., Marketing Manager, Software Engineer, Freelancer)

3. "Where do you work?" (optional - they can skip this)

4. "Let's talk about your goals. I like to track two types:"

   **Work goals** - These are things related to your job:
   - KPIs you're trying to hit
   - Projects you want to ship
   - Skills you want to develop professionally
   - Team goals you're contributing to

   **Personal goals** - These are about your life outside work:
   - Health habits (walking 10k steps, going to the gym)
   - Creative projects (writing a blog every week, learning guitar)
   - Relationships, hobbies, personal growth

   Ask: "What are some goals you're working toward? Start with whatever comes to mind - we can always add more later as we get to know each other."

   After they share, reassure them:
   > "These aren't set in stone. As we work together, I'll get to know your priorities and help you make progress on what matters. We can update these anytime - just tell me 'I want to add a new goal' or 'let's update my goals.'"

5. "How would you like me to communicate with you?"
   - Professional (clear, direct, business-like)
   - Casual (friendly, relaxed, conversational)
   - Sarcastic (dry wit, like the original Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide)

### Step 3: Create Your Workspace

This is where we set up the user's personal MARVIN workspace, separate from the template.

Explain:
> "Now I'm going to create your personal MARVIN workspace. This is where all your data, goals, and session logs will live. The template you downloaded will stay separate so you can get updates later."

Ask where they'd like their MARVIN folder:
> "Where would you like your MARVIN folder to live? I'd suggest somewhere easy to find:
> - **Desktop** - Right there when you need it
> - **Documents** - Tucked away but organized
>
> Just say 'desktop' or 'documents', or tell me a different spot if you have somewhere in mind."

**After they respond, explain what's about to happen:**
> "Great! I'm going to run a few quick setup commands to create your workspace. You'll see some permission prompts pop up - just click **Accept** for each one. This is totally normal - I'm just:
> - Creating your MARVIN folder
> - Copying over the necessary files (commands, skills, etc.)
> - Setting up your personal state files
>
> This will only take a moment."

**Create the workspace:**

Run these commands (using their chosen path - `~/Desktop/marvin` or `~/Documents/marvin`):

```bash
# Create the workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/marvin

# Copy the user-facing files from the template
cp -r .claude ~/marvin/
cp -r skills ~/marvin/
cp -r state ~/marvin/
cp CLAUDE.md ~/marvin/
cp .env.example ~/marvin/

# Create empty directories for user data
mkdir -p ~/marvin/sessions
mkdir -p ~/marvin/reports
mkdir -p ~/marvin/content

# Create .marvin-source file pointing to this template
echo "$(pwd)" > ~/marvin/.marvin-source
```

**What gets copied:**
- `.claude/` - The slash commands
- `skills/` - MARVIN's capabilities (user can add their own)
- `state/` - Current priorities and goals (will be personalized)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main context file (will be personalized)
- `.env.example` - Template for API keys

**What stays in the template:**
- `.marvin/` - Setup scripts and integrations (run from here when needed)
- `sessions/`, `reports/`, `content/` - Created fresh in workspace

Tell the user:
> "I've created your MARVIN workspace at {path}. This is your personal space - all your data stays here. The template folder stays separate so you can get updates when new features are added."

### Step 4: Set Up Git (Optional)

Ask: "Would you like to track your MARVIN workspace with git? This lets you back up your data and optionally sync it to GitHub."

If yes:
```bash
cd ~/marvin
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial MARVIN setup"
```

Then ask: "Do you want to connect this to a GitHub repository? If so, create a **private** repository on GitHub and paste the URL here. Or press Enter to skip - you can always add this later."

If they provide a URL:
```bash
git remote add origin {their-url}
git push -u origin main
```

If they skip or say no:
> "No problem! Your workspace is set up locally. You can always add GitHub later if you want to back things up."

### Step 5: Create Their Profile

Now update the files **in the new workspace** with their info:

**Update `~/marvin/state/goals.md`** with their goals organized by type:
```markdown
# Goals

Last updated: {TODAY'S DATE}

## Work Goals

- {Work goal 1}
- {Work goal 2}
...

## Personal Goals

- {Personal goal 1}
- {Personal goal 2}
...

## Tracking

| Goal | Type | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| {Goal 1} | Work | Not started | |
| {Goal 2} | Personal | Not started | |
...
```

**Update `~/marvin/state/current.md`**:
```markdown
# Current State

Last updated: {TODAY'S DATE}

## Active Priorities

1. Complete MARVIN setup
2. {Their first priority if they mentioned one}

## Open Threads

- None yet

## Recent Context

- Just set up MARVIN!
```

**Update `~/marvin/CLAUDE.md`** - Replace the "User Profile" section with their actual info:
```markdown
## User Profile

**Name:** {Their name}
**Role:** {Their role} at {Their company, if provided}

**Goals:**
- {Goal 1}
- {Goal 2}
...

**Communication Style:** {Their preference - Professional/Casual/Sarcastic}
```

### Step 6: Quick Launch Shortcut (Optional)

Ask: "Would you like to be able to start me by just typing `marvin` anywhere in the terminal? It's a quick shortcut that makes it easier to open me up."

If yes, **set it up directly** (don't ask them to run a script):

1. Detect their shell: `echo $SHELL`
2. Determine config file: `.zshrc` for zsh, `.bashrc` for bash, `.profile` otherwise
3. Check if `marvin()` function already exists in that file
4. If not, append this function:

```bash
# MARVIN - AI Chief of Staff
marvin() {
    echo -e '\e[1;33m███╗   ███╗    █████╗    ██████╗   ██╗   ██╗  ██╗   ███╗   ██╗   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m████╗ ████║   ██╔══██╗   ██╔══██╗  ██║   ██║  ██║   ████╗  ██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██╔████╔██║   ███████║   ██████╔╝  ██║   ██║  ██║   ██╔██╗ ██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██║╚██╔╝██║   ██╔══██║   ██╔══██╗  ╚██╗ ██╔╝  ██║   ██║╚██╗██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██║ ╚═╝ ██║██╗██║  ██║██╗██║  ██║██╗╚████╔╝██╗██║██╗██║ ╚████║██╗\e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m╚═╝     ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝ ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚═╝\e[0m'
    echo ''
    cd "{WORKSPACE_PATH}" && claude
}
```

Replace `{WORKSPACE_PATH}` with their actual workspace path (e.g., `~/marvin`).

5. Tell them: "Done! After we finish here, open a new terminal and you can start me anytime by typing `marvin`."

If they skip: "No worries! You can always navigate to your MARVIN folder and run `claude` to start me."

### Step 7: Explain the Daily Workflow

Explain how a typical day with MARVIN works:

> "Here's how we'll work together each day:"
>
> **Start your day:** Type `/start` and I'll give you a briefing - your priorities, what's on deck, and anything you need to know.
>
> **Work through your day:** Just talk to me naturally. Tell me what you're working on, ask questions, have me help with tasks.
>
> **Save progress as you go:** If you finish something or want to capture what you've done, type `/update`. This saves your progress to today's session log without ending our conversation. Great for when you're switching tasks or want to make sure I remember something important.
>
> **End your day:** Type `/end` when you're done. I'll summarize everything we covered and save it so I remember next time.
>
> "Think of `/start` and `/end` as bookends for your work session. Everything in between is just conversation."

Then show the full command list:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Start your day with a briefing |
| `/end` | End your session and save everything |
| `/update` | Save progress mid-session (without ending) |
| `/report` | Generate a weekly summary of your work |
| `/commit` | Review code changes and create git commits |
| `/code` | Open this folder in your IDE |
| `/help` | See all commands and integrations |

### Step 8: Explain How I Work

This is important - set expectations about MARVIN's personality:

> "One more thing: I'm not just here to agree with everything you say. When you're brainstorming or making decisions, I'll:
> - Help you explore different options
> - Push back if I see potential issues
> - Ask questions to make sure you've considered all angles
> - Play devil's advocate when it's helpful
>
> Think of me as a thought partner, not a yes-man. If you want me to just execute without questioning, just say so - but by default, I'll help you think things through."

### Step 9: Connect Your Tools (Optional)

Tell them about the template first:
> "One more thing before we wrap up: **Keep the template folder you downloaded.** That's where I get updates from. When new features or integrations are added, you can run `/sync` to pull them into your workspace. Don't worry - your personal data is safe in your MARVIN folder and won't be overwritten."

Then ask about integrations:
> "I can connect to several tools to help you out. Which of these do you use?"
>
> - **Jira/Confluence** - Track tickets, search documentation
> - **Microsoft 365** - Outlook email, calendar, OneDrive, Teams
> - **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive
> - **Slack** - Search messages, send updates
>
> "Just tell me which ones you'd like to connect, or say 'none' to skip for now."

**If they say no or skip:**

> "No problem! We can always add these later. Just ask me anytime - 'Hey MARVIN, help me connect to Jira' - and I'll walk you through it."

Move directly to Step 10.

**If they say yes**, collect preferences for each integration they want:

---

#### Collecting Integration Preferences

**For Jira/Confluence (Atlassian):** *(Easy - just needs login)*
- Ask: "Should Jira be available in all your projects, or just this one?" (all = user scope, this one = project scope)

**For Microsoft 365:** *(Easy - just needs login)*
- Ask: "Is this a work/school account or personal (outlook.com)?" (work = `--org-mode`)
- Ask: "All MS365 tools or just essentials (mail, calendar, files)?" (essentials = `--preset mail,calendar,files`)
- Ask: "Available in all projects or just this one?" (all = user scope)

**For Google Workspace:** *(Needs OAuth credentials)*
> "Google needs OAuth credentials to connect. Do you already have a Google Cloud project with OAuth set up?"

- **If yes:** Ask for their Client ID and Client Secret
- **If no:**
  > "No worries! Setting up Google OAuth takes about 5 minutes. Here's what you'll need to do:
  >
  > 1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  > 2. Create a project (or use an existing one)
  > 3. Enable the Gmail, Calendar, and Drive APIs
  > 4. Create OAuth credentials (Desktop app type)
  > 5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
  >
  > Want me to walk you through it now, or should we skip Google for now and add it later?"

  If they want to do it now, guide them step by step. If not, skip Google.

**For Slack:** *(Needs API token)*
> "Slack needs an API token to connect. Do you already have a Slack app with a User Token?"

- **If yes:** Ask for their token (starts with `xoxp-`)
- **If no:**
  > "No problem! Creating a Slack app takes about 5 minutes. Here's what you'll need:
  >
  > 1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
  > 2. Create a new app for your workspace
  > 3. Add the permissions (I'll tell you which ones)
  > 4. Install it and copy the User OAuth Token
  >
  > Want me to walk you through it now, or should we skip Slack for now?"

  If they want to do it now, guide them through creating the Slack app and getting the token. If not, skip Slack.

---

#### Adding the Integrations

Once you've collected their preferences, run the appropriate `claude mcp add` commands:

**Atlassian (Jira/Confluence):**
```bash
claude mcp remove atlassian 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add atlassian -s user --transport http https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp
# Remove "-s user" for project scope
```

**Microsoft 365:**
```bash
claude mcp remove ms365 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add ms365 -s user -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --org-mode
# Remove "-s user" for project scope
# Remove "--org-mode" for personal accounts
# Add "--preset mail,calendar,files" for essentials only
```

**Google Workspace:** *(Only if they provided credentials)*
```bash
claude mcp remove google-workspace 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add google-workspace -s user \
    --env GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="{their_client_id}" \
    --env GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="{their_client_secret}" \
    -- uvx workspace-mcp --tools gmail drive calendar docs sheets slides
```

**Slack:** *(Only if they provided a token)*
```bash
claude mcp remove slack 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add slack -s user \
    -e SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN="{their_token}" \
    -- npx -y slack-mcp-server@latest --transport stdio
```

---

#### Creating the Pending Auth File

After adding integrations, create a file to track what needs `/mcp` authentication:

```bash
# In the user's workspace (e.g., ~/marvin)
cat > .onboarding-pending-auth << 'EOF'
# Integrations pending authentication
# MARVIN will read this file on next startup and guide you through auth

atlassian
ms365
EOF
```

**Note:** Only Atlassian and MS365 need `/mcp` authentication after restart. Google and Slack authenticate on first use (Google opens browser, Slack uses the token directly).

Only include integrations that actually need `/mcp` auth.

---

#### Continue to Step 10

After adding integrations (and creating the pending auth file if needed), continue to Step 10.

### Step 10: Wrap Up and Restart

**Tell them we're done and need to restart:**

> "That's everything! Your MARVIN is all set up."

**If they set up integrations:**
> "I've added your integrations, but I need to restart to see them. Here's what to do:
>
> 1. Type `exit` to close me
> 2. Close this terminal window completely
> 3. Open a new terminal
> 4. Type `marvin` to start me up again
>
> When you come back, I'll walk you through connecting your accounts - it'll just take a minute. Then type `/start` for your first real briefing!
>
> Ready? Type `exit` and I'll see you in a moment!"

**Wait for them to exit.** They will return via the "Resuming After Restart" flow at the top of this document.

**If they skipped integrations:**
> "To finish up, you'll need to restart your terminal for the `marvin` command to work. Here's what to do:
>
> 1. Type `exit` to close me
> 2. Close this terminal window completely
> 3. Open a new terminal
> 4. Type `marvin` to start me up again
> 5. Type `/start` for your first briefing!
>
> Ready? Type `exit` and I'll see you soon!"

**After they run `/start` (either path):**
Delete the `.onboarding-pending-auth` file if it exists, then give them their first briefing using the normal `/start` flow.

---

## After Onboarding

Once setup is complete, MARVIN should:
1. Never show this onboarding flow again
2. Use the normal `/start` briefing flow
3. Reference CLAUDE.md for the user's profile and preferences
4. Run from the user's workspace directory (e.g., ~/marvin), not the template

## Getting Updates (/sync)

When the user runs `/sync`, MARVIN should:
1. Read `.marvin-source` to find the template directory
2. Check for new/updated files in the template's `.claude/commands/` and `skills/`
3. Copy new files to the user's workspace
4. For conflicts, the user's version is the source of truth (don't overwrite)
5. Report what was updated
