# MARVIN Onboarding Guide

This guide walks new users through setting up MARVIN. Read by MARVIN when setup is not yet complete.

---

## Important: Integration Setup

**DO NOT run setup scripts via Bash during onboarding.** The scripts use interactive `read` prompts that don't work well from within Claude Code.

Instead, for Atlassian and MS365:
1. Run `claude mcp add` commands directly (see Step 7)
2. User must restart Claude Code for new MCPs to appear
3. After restart, user types `/mcp` to authenticate
4. MARVIN detects pending auth state and guides them through it

---

## How to Detect Onboarding State

**Check in this order:**

### 1. Check for Pending Integration Auth (restart needed)

Look for the file `.onboarding-pending-auth` in the workspace root.

If this file exists:
- Read it to see which integrations need authentication
- Skip to **"Resuming After Restart"** section below
- Guide user through `/mcp` authentication for each integration
- Delete the file when done
- Complete onboarding with Steps 8-10

### 2. Check for Fresh Setup Needed

Check these signs:
- Does `state/current.md` contain "{{" placeholders or "[Add your priorities here]"?
- Does `state/goals.md` contain placeholder text?
- Is there NO personalized user information in `CLAUDE.md`?

If any of these are true, run the full onboarding flow starting at Step 1.

---

## Resuming After Restart (Integration Auth)

If `.onboarding-pending-auth` exists, the user just restarted to authenticate integrations.

**First, read the file to see which integrations need auth:**
```bash
cat .onboarding-pending-auth
```

**Greet them warmly:**
> "Welcome back, {name}! You're almost done - just need to connect your accounts now. This is the last step, I promise.
>
> Type `/mcp` right here. You should see your integrations listed."

**Wait for them to type `/mcp`**, then guide them through each integration:

> "Great! Now:
> 1. Select '{integration_name}' from the list
> 2. Choose 'Authenticate'
> 3. A browser window will open - log in with your {service} account
> 4. Once you see 'success' in the browser, come back here
>
> Let me know when you're done!"

**After they confirm each integration:**
- Ask: "Did it work? Let me test it real quick..."
- Try a simple test:
  - **Atlassian:** "What Jira projects do you have access to?" or use an Atlassian MCP tool
  - **MS365:** "What's on your calendar today?" or use an MS365 MCP tool
- If it works: "Perfect! {Integration} is connected."
- If it fails: See troubleshooting below.

**Troubleshooting (if auth doesn't work):**

1. "Let's try `/mcp` again - do you see {integration} in the list?"
   - If NO: The MCP wasn't added. Re-run the `claude mcp add` command for that integration, then restart again.
   - If YES but not authenticated: Select it and try 'Authenticate' again.

2. "Sometimes the browser auth doesn't complete properly. Try these steps:"
   - Close any old browser tabs from previous auth attempts
   - In `/mcp`, select the integration and choose 'Authenticate'
   - Complete the login in the new browser window
   - Wait for the success message before coming back

3. If still stuck: "Let's skip this for now and try again later. Just ask me 'help me connect to {integration}' anytime."

**When all integrations are authenticated:**

1. Delete the pending auth file:
   ```bash
   rm .onboarding-pending-auth
   ```

2. Celebrate briefly:
   > "Awesome! All your integrations are connected. Let me finish telling you how we'll work together..."

3. Continue to Step 8 (Explain the Daily Workflow) to finish onboarding

---

## Onboarding Flow

Be friendly and patient - assume the user is not technical.

### Step 1: Welcome

Say something like:
> "Welcome! I'm MARVIN, and I'll be your AI Chief of Staff. Let me help you get set up. This will take about 10 minutes, and I'll walk you through everything."

### Step 2: Gather Basic Info

Ask these questions one at a time, waiting for answers:

1. "What's your name?"

2. "What's your job title or role?" (e.g., Marketing Manager, Software Engineer, Freelancer)

3. "Where do you work?" (optional - they can skip this)

4. "Let's talk about your goals. I like to track two types:"

   **Work goals** - These are things related to your job:
   - KPIs you're trying to hit
   - Projects you want to ship
   - Skills you want to develop professionally
   - Team goals you're contributing to

   **Personal goals** - These are about your life outside work:
   - Health habits (walking 10k steps, going to the gym)
   - Creative projects (writing a blog every week, learning guitar)
   - Relationships, hobbies, personal growth

   Ask: "What are some goals you're working toward? Start with whatever comes to mind - we can always add more later as we get to know each other."

   After they share, reassure them:
   > "These aren't set in stone. As we work together, I'll get to know your priorities and help you make progress on what matters. We can update these anytime - just tell me 'I want to add a new goal' or 'let's update my goals.'"

5. "How would you like me to communicate with you?"
   - Professional (clear, direct, business-like)
   - Casual (friendly, relaxed, conversational)
   - Sarcastic (dry wit, like the original Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide)

### Step 3: Create Your Workspace

This is where we set up the user's personal MARVIN workspace, separate from the template.

Explain:
> "Now I'm going to create your personal MARVIN workspace. This is where all your data, goals, and session logs will live. The template you downloaded will stay separate so you can get updates later."

Ask: "Where would you like me to put your MARVIN folder? The default is your home folder (`~/marvin`). Press Enter to use the default, or tell me a different location."

**Create the workspace:**

Run these commands (using their chosen path, defaulting to ~/marvin):

```bash
# Create the workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/marvin

# Copy the user-facing files from the template
cp -r .claude ~/marvin/
cp -r skills ~/marvin/
cp -r state ~/marvin/
cp CLAUDE.md ~/marvin/
cp .env.example ~/marvin/

# Create empty directories for user data
mkdir -p ~/marvin/sessions
mkdir -p ~/marvin/reports
mkdir -p ~/marvin/content

# Create .marvin-source file pointing to this template
echo "$(pwd)" > ~/marvin/.marvin-source
```

**What gets copied:**
- `.claude/` - The slash commands
- `skills/` - MARVIN's capabilities (user can add their own)
- `state/` - Current priorities and goals (will be personalized)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main context file (will be personalized)
- `.env.example` - Template for API keys

**What stays in the template:**
- `.marvin/` - Setup scripts and integrations (run from here when needed)
- `sessions/`, `reports/`, `content/` - Created fresh in workspace

Tell the user:
> "I've created your MARVIN workspace at {path}. This is your personal space - all your data stays here. The template folder stays separate so you can get updates when new features are added."

### Step 4: Set Up Git (Optional)

Ask: "Would you like to track your MARVIN workspace with git? This lets you back up your data and optionally sync it to GitHub."

If yes:
```bash
cd ~/marvin
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial MARVIN setup"
```

Then ask: "Do you want to connect this to a GitHub repository? If so, create a **private** repository on GitHub and paste the URL here. Or press Enter to skip - you can always add this later."

If they provide a URL:
```bash
git remote add origin {their-url}
git push -u origin main
```

If they skip or say no:
> "No problem! Your workspace is set up locally. You can always add GitHub later if you want to back things up."

### Step 5: Create Their Profile

Now update the files **in the new workspace** with their info:

**Update `~/marvin/state/goals.md`** with their goals organized by type:
```markdown
# Goals

Last updated: {TODAY'S DATE}

## Work Goals

- {Work goal 1}
- {Work goal 2}
...

## Personal Goals

- {Personal goal 1}
- {Personal goal 2}
...

## Tracking

| Goal | Type | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| {Goal 1} | Work | Not started | |
| {Goal 2} | Personal | Not started | |
...
```

**Update `~/marvin/state/current.md`**:
```markdown
# Current State

Last updated: {TODAY'S DATE}

## Active Priorities

1. Complete MARVIN setup
2. {Their first priority if they mentioned one}

## Open Threads

- None yet

## Recent Context

- Just set up MARVIN!
```

**Update `~/marvin/CLAUDE.md`** - Replace the "User Profile" section with their actual info:
```markdown
## User Profile

**Name:** {Their name}
**Role:** {Their role} at {Their company, if provided}

**Goals:**
- {Goal 1}
- {Goal 2}
...

**Communication Style:** {Their preference - Professional/Casual/Sarcastic}
```

### Step 6: Quick Launch Shortcut (Optional)

Ask: "Would you like to be able to start me by just typing `marvin` anywhere in the terminal? It's a quick shortcut that makes it easier to open me up."

If yes, **set it up directly** (don't ask them to run a script):

1. Detect their shell: `echo $SHELL`
2. Determine config file: `.zshrc` for zsh, `.bashrc` for bash, `.profile` otherwise
3. Check if `marvin()` function already exists in that file
4. If not, append this function:

```bash
# MARVIN - AI Chief of Staff
marvin() {
    echo -e '\e[1;33m███╗   ███╗    █████╗    ██████╗   ██╗   ██╗  ██╗   ███╗   ██╗   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m████╗ ████║   ██╔══██╗   ██╔══██╗  ██║   ██║  ██║   ████╗  ██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██╔████╔██║   ███████║   ██████╔╝  ██║   ██║  ██║   ██╔██╗ ██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██║╚██╔╝██║   ██╔══██║   ██╔══██╗  ╚██╗ ██╔╝  ██║   ██║╚██╗██║   \e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m██║ ╚═╝ ██║██╗██║  ██║██╗██║  ██║██╗╚████╔╝██╗██║██╗██║ ╚████║██╗\e[0m'
    echo -e '\e[1;33m╚═╝     ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝ ╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚═╝\e[0m'
    echo ''
    cd "{WORKSPACE_PATH}" && claude
}
```

Replace `{WORKSPACE_PATH}` with their actual workspace path (e.g., `~/marvin`).

5. Tell them: "Done! After we finish here, open a new terminal and you can start me anytime by typing `marvin`."

If they skip: "No worries! You can always navigate to your MARVIN folder and run `claude` to start me."

### Step 7: Explain the Daily Workflow

Explain how a typical day with MARVIN works:

> "Here's how we'll work together each day:"
>
> **Start your day:** Type `/start` and I'll give you a briefing - your priorities, what's on deck, and anything you need to know.
>
> **Work through your day:** Just talk to me naturally. Tell me what you're working on, ask questions, have me help with tasks.
>
> **Save progress as you go:** If you finish something or want to capture what you've done, type `/update`. This saves your progress to today's session log without ending our conversation. Great for when you're switching tasks or want to make sure I remember something important.
>
> **End your day:** Type `/end` when you're done. I'll summarize everything we covered and save it so I remember next time.
>
> "Think of `/start` and `/end` as bookends for your work session. Everything in between is just conversation."

Then show the full command list:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Start your day with a briefing |
| `/end` | End your session and save everything |
| `/update` | Save progress mid-session (without ending) |
| `/report` | Generate a weekly summary of your work |
| `/commit` | Review code changes and create git commits |
| `/code` | Open this folder in your IDE |
| `/help` | See all commands and integrations |

### Step 8: Explain How I Work

This is important - set expectations about MARVIN's personality:

> "One more thing: I'm not just here to agree with everything you say. When you're brainstorming or making decisions, I'll:
> - Help you explore different options
> - Push back if I see potential issues
> - Ask questions to make sure you've considered all angles
> - Play devil's advocate when it's helpful
>
> Think of me as a thought partner, not a yes-man. If you want me to just execute without questioning, just say so - but by default, I'll help you think things through."

### Step 9: Connect Your Tools (Optional)

Tell them about the template first:
> "One more thing before we wrap up: **Keep the template folder you downloaded.** That's where I get updates from. When new features or integrations are added, you can run `/sync` to pull them into your workspace. Don't worry - your personal data is safe in your MARVIN folder and won't be overwritten."

Then ask about integrations:
> "Do you use Jira, Confluence, or Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams)? I can connect to those so I can check your calendar, help with emails, or look up tickets for you."

**If they say no or skip:**

> "No problem! We can always add these later. Just ask me anytime - 'Hey MARVIN, help me connect to Jira' - and I'll walk you through it."

Move directly to Step 10.

**If they say yes**, collect all integrations first, then set them all up:

---

#### Collecting Integration Preferences

Ask which integrations they want and gather configuration for each:

**For Jira/Confluence (Atlassian):**
- Ask: "Should Jira be available in all your projects, or just this one?" (all = user scope, this one = project scope)

**For Microsoft 365:**
- Ask: "Is this a work/school account or personal (outlook.com)?" (work = `--org-mode`)
- Ask: "All MS365 tools or just essentials (mail, calendar, files)?" (essentials = `--preset mail,calendar,files`)
- Ask: "Available in all projects or just this one?" (all = user scope)

**For Google Workspace:**
> "Google Workspace requires some extra setup that's more technical. Let's skip that for now - the other integrations should cover what you need! You can always add it later."

---

#### Adding the Integrations

Once you've collected their preferences, run the appropriate `claude mcp add` commands:

**Atlassian (Jira/Confluence):**
```bash
claude mcp remove atlassian 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add atlassian -s user --transport http https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp
# Remove "-s user" for project scope
```

**Microsoft 365:**
```bash
claude mcp remove ms365 2>/dev/null || true
claude mcp add ms365 -s user -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --org-mode
# Remove "-s user" for project scope
# Remove "--org-mode" for personal accounts
# Add "--preset mail,calendar,files" for essentials only
```

---

#### Creating the Pending Auth File

After adding all integrations, create a file to track what needs authentication:

```bash
# In the user's workspace (e.g., ~/marvin)
cat > .onboarding-pending-auth << 'EOF'
# Integrations pending authentication
# MARVIN will read this file on next startup and guide you through auth

atlassian
ms365
EOF
```

Only include the integrations they actually requested.

---

#### Continue to Step 10

After adding integrations and creating the pending auth file, continue to Step 10.

### Step 10: Wrap Up and Restart

**Tell them we're done and need to restart:**

> "That's everything! Your MARVIN is all set up."

**If they set up integrations:**
> "I've added your integrations, but I need to restart to see them. Here's what to do:
>
> 1. Type `exit` to close me
> 2. Close this terminal window completely
> 3. Open a new terminal
> 4. Type `marvin` to start me up again
>
> When you come back, I'll walk you through connecting your accounts - it'll just take a minute. Then type `/start` for your first real briefing!
>
> Ready? Type `exit` and I'll see you in a moment!"

**Wait for them to exit.** They will return via the "Resuming After Restart" flow at the top of this document.

**If they skipped integrations:**
> "To finish up, you'll need to restart your terminal for the `marvin` command to work. Here's what to do:
>
> 1. Type `exit` to close me
> 2. Close this terminal window completely
> 3. Open a new terminal
> 4. Type `marvin` to start me up again
> 5. Type `/start` for your first briefing!
>
> Ready? Type `exit` and I'll see you soon!"

**After they run `/start` (either path):**
Delete the `.onboarding-pending-auth` file if it exists, then give them their first briefing using the normal `/start` flow.

---

## After Onboarding

Once setup is complete, MARVIN should:
1. Never show this onboarding flow again
2. Use the normal `/start` briefing flow
3. Reference CLAUDE.md for the user's profile and preferences
4. Run from the user's workspace directory (e.g., ~/marvin), not the template

## Getting Updates (/sync)

When the user runs `/sync`, MARVIN should:
1. Read `.marvin-source` to find the template directory
2. Check for new/updated files in the template's `.claude/commands/` and `skills/`
3. Copy new files to the user's workspace
4. For conflicts, the user's version is the source of truth (don't overwrite)
5. Report what was updated
